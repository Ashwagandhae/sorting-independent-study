## 2-1.1

insertion sort demo:
[(31), 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
take 31, don't move

[31, (41), 59, 26, 41, 58]
take 41, don't move

[31, 41, (59), 26, 41, 58]
take 59, don't move

[31, 41, 59, (26), 41, 58]
take 26
swap 59
swap 41
swap 31

[26, 31, 41, 59, (41), 58]
take 41
swap 59

[26, 31, 41, 41, 59, (58)]
take 58
swap 59

[26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]
done

## 2-1.4

```python
def linear_search(arr: [int], v: int) -> int | None:
    ret = None
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == v:
            ret = i # no break because its easier to prove
    return ret
```

proof that it works:
loop invariant:{initialization, maintenance, termination}

invariant: ret is the index of the first occurence of v in arr
initialization: at the start of the loop, the array subsection is [], so the invariant is true (ret is None, and empty arr has no v)
maintenance: if arr[i] == v, then ret = i, so the invariant is true, else ret = last loop's ret which was true
termination: observe that the loop terminates when i = len(arr), meaning we checked whole array. given that invariant was true last loop, it is true.

## 2-1.4

Input: A 2 n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B

Output: The sum of the two integers, stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C

```python
def add(n1: [int], n2: [int]) -> [int]:
    ret = [0] * (len(n1) + 1)
    carry = 0
    for i in range(len(n1) - 1, -1, -1):
        digit = n1[i] + n2[i] + carry
        ret[i + 1] = digit % 2
        carry = digit // 2
    ret[0] = carry
    return ret
```

## 2-2.1

n^3

## 2-2.2

see code

## 2-2-3

average = n/2 where n = len(arr) # well in my algorithm it is always n
worst = nz

o(n) for both

## 2-2-4

check if one case is already the right answer, if not, do the algorithm

## 2-3-2

the purpose of the check p >= r is to make sure that the current array is larger than zero. p will only go down towards r by 1 each time, so you can also do p != r because it will never be p > r.

## 2-3-3

invariant: arr[p:k] is sorted
initialization: k = p, so arr is empty so it's sorted by
maintenance: L and R are given sorted. the 2 indices i, j correspond to L, R, starting at their respective starts. to maintain sorting, things added to A[k] must be smallest elements after things already added to arr. because L and R are sorted, and L[0:i] and R[0:j] are already added, then the value of L[i] <= R[j] ? L[i] : R[j] must be the smallest possible, mainting.
termination: when the loop completes, either i >= L.len or j >= R.len. the array isn't sorted yet, however, the two while loops will add the rest of the elements from L or R, which are sorted and guaranteed to be bigger than all other els in arr, so the arr will be sorted.

## 2-3-5

```python
def insertion_sort_rec(arr: [int], i = 0):
    if i == len(arr):
        return
    insertion_sort_rec(arr, i + 1)
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
        arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
        j -= 1
```

## 2-3-6

```python
def binary_search(arr: [int], v: int) -> int | None: # assume arr is sorted
    return binary_search_rec(arr, v, 0, len(arr) - 1)

def binary_search_rec(arr: [int], v: int, l: int, r: int) -> int | None:
    if l > r:
        return None
    m = (l + r) // 2
    if arr[m] == v:
        return m
    elif arr[m] > v:
        return binary_search_rec(arr, v, l, m - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search_rec(arr, v, m + 1, r)
```
