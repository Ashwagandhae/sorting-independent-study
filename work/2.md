insertion sort demo:
[(31), 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
take 31, don't move

[31, (41), 59, 26, 41, 58]
take 41, don't move

[31, 41, (59), 26, 41, 58]
take 59, don't move

[31, 41, 59, (26), 41, 58]
take 26
swap 59
swap 41
swap 31

[26, 31, 41, 59, (41), 58]
take 41
swap 59

[26, 31, 41, 41, 59, (58)]
take 58
swap 59

# 2.1.4

```python
def linear_search(arr: [int], v: int) -> int | None:
    ret = None
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == v:
            ret = i # no break because its easier to prove
    return ret
```

proof that it works:
loop invariant:{initialization, maintenance, termination}

invariant: ret is the index of the first occurence of v in arr
initialization: at the start of the loop, the array subsection is [], so the invariant is true (ret is None, and empty arr has no v)
maintenance: if arr[i] == v, then ret = i, so the invariant is true, else ret = last loop's ret which was true
termination: observe that the loop terminates when i = len(arr), meaning we checked whole array. given that invariant was true last loop, it is true.

# 2.1.4

Input: A 2 n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B

Output: The sum of the two integers, stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C

```python
def add(n1: [int], n2: [int]) -> [int]:
    ret = [0] * (len(n1) + 1)
    carry = 0
    for i in range(len(n1) - 1, -1, -1):
        digit = n1[i] + n2[i] + carry
        ret[i + 1] = digit % 2
        carry = digit // 2
    ret[0] = carry
    return ret
```

# 2.2.1

n^3

# 2.2.2

see code

# 2.2-3

average = n/2 where n = len(arr) # well in my algorithm it is always n
worst = n

o(n) for both

# 2.2-4

check if one case is already the right answer, if not, do the algorithm
