# Notes

O = upper bound, can be not tight
o = upper bound, not tight
def: O(g(n)) = {f(n) : there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 0 <= f(n) <= cg(n) for all n >= n0}

Ω = lower bound, can be not tight
ω = lower bound, not tight
def: Ω(g(n)) = {f(n) : there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 0 <= cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0}

Θ = tight bound
def: Θ(g(n)) = {f(n) : there exists positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that 0 <= c1g(n) <= f(n) <= c2g(n) for all n >= n0}

f(n) = Θ(g(n)) <=> f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n))

Transitivity:
f(n) = X(g(n)) and g(n) = X (h(n)) imply f(n) = X(h(n)) where X = Θ, O, Ω, o, ω

Reflexivity:
f(n) = Θ(f(n))
f(n) = O(f(n))
f(n) = Ω(f(n))

Symmetry:
f(n) = Θ(g(n)) <=> g(n) = Θ(f(n))

Transposition:
f(n) = O(g(n)) <=> g(n) = Ω(f(n))
f(n) = o(g(n)) <=> g(n) = ω(f(n))

# Problems

## 3-2.2

Because O(n^2) is upper bound, so it would be restricted to n^2, but "at least" makes that upper bound go up forever.

## 3-2.3

2^(n + 1) = O(2^n)? yes, because 2^(n + 1) = 2 \* 2^n, so c = 2
2^(2n) = O(2^n)? no, because 2^(2n) = (2^n)^2, which is not linear
